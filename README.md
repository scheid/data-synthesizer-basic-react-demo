# Data Synthesizer Basic: React Demo

This is a React demo application, illustrating how to use the [data-synthesizer-basic](https://www.npmjs.com/package/data-synthesizer-basic) NPM package in a React application.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

When you first clone this, be sure to run `npm install` as per the usual process.

Then in the project directory, you can run `npm start`, which will start the demo in development mode. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.
